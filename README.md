# 🌍 Global Terrorism Attack Type Prediction

This project uses **Deep Learning (PyTorch)** to predict the type of terrorist attack based on event details like date, location, and casualties.  
It provides a **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Input event details (year, month, day, casualties, location).
- Predict the **most likely attack type**.
- Uses pretrained **PyTorch model weights**, **scaler**, and **label encoder**.
- Simple web app powered by **Streamlit**.
